# Vehicure
Vehicure is a product designed towards raising sustainability standards in modern vehicles acting as an additive to existing telematic unit.
Currently biggest back-set faced by our country is pollution especially in places like Delhi where air toxicity is well beyond bars.
More than 45% of this pollution are by products of vehicular emissions given by official stats of our country.
Given the major component in GHG being CO2, CO and NH3 our project mainly focus on effectively controlling the emission of these toxic gases from vehicles.
Our product also addresses various violations performed by the driver and fine them accordingly.

Our system has an installed camera module which is programmed to Detect Drowsiness via Computer Vision Techniques.
We have also included the factor of detecting whether the user is using mobile devices while driving their vehicle and alert them accordingly.
Once the user is classified to be asleep by analysing his eye patterns per 50 frame then the installed buzzer will start ringing continuously to wake up the driver.
Also, if the driver is distracted while driving, like using mobile phones then it will also be classified under violation.

GPS technology and on-board diagnostics (OBD) to plot the asset's movements on a computerized map.
A telematics engineer will be working in Linux environments, either to administer the device or to use it to automate processes. Thus, Bash is a language that comes with all Unix based systems. It is an excellent scripting language for automating tasks
The Telematics Control Unit (TCU), which is the central hardware module of the telematics device, has communication interfaces with the in-vehicle network (CAN Bus) and the backend cloud server( GPRS) . TCU collects the crucial vehicle data such as diagnostics data, real time location, and speed of the vehicle (through different interfaces) and sends them to the cloud server over wireless network such as GPRS/cellular/LTE , in a specific packaged format.
